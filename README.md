# DigitalKataclysm
Larave inspired Framework for small projects. 

Working with PHP it tries to emulate how frameworks such as Laravel works, but in their minimal 
state and the maximun code reach. Its not intended for final users or huge projects ( not yet), 
but in the future it can take that path.

## Requirements

This framework was made using PHP 7.1. That means that we are not providing backward compatibility 
with older versions of PHP (Sorry, we have to aim for the future).

## Environment

Right now I am working in the [PHP STORM](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)  IDE. If in the future we find a better IDE to work PHP then we will switch,
but for now, I am very comfortable using it. If you want to give it a try go ahead. 

## Want to help me?

If you are willing to spend some time checking the code and adding improvements, 
you can request a PUSH to this repository and I will, personally, check it and add it.

I accept all kinds of help from full design pages to classes and even composer requirements that you
can suggest. Just be sure to comment all you can, links from where you are taking the classes of methods
or even a little poetry of how you manage to get that awesome logic in your code.

Your reward? You will be able to use this little project for small ideas or sites wherever you like, 
and even you can folk it and modify it yourself. What is better than that? Maybe other frameworks are
not suitable for your needs, so why just don't take this one and make it exactly as you want?
